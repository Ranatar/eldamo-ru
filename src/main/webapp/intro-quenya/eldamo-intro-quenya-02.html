<p>This is the first of two sections on pronunciation. This course primarily teaches Quenya for reading and writing, since many people use Quenya in places like online chats, games or forums where writing is the only option. However, you should know enough about how Quenya is pronounced that you don’t sound like an idiot, so we need to cover basic pronunciation. This section covers vowels; consonants will be covered in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-03.html">Chapter 3</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="c2-1-1"></a>2.1.1 Vowels</h2>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="#c2-1-1-1">2.1.1.1 Quenya Vowels</a></b></li>

<li class="advanced-topic"><b><a href="#c2-1-1-5">2.1.1.5 Advanced Topic: How do we know this?</a></b></li>
</ul>

<p><a id="c2-1-1-1"></a><b>2.1.1.1 Quenya Vowels:</b> In English, the same vowel may have different sounds in different words. Consider “mad”, “made” and “father”: all use the vowel “a” but the vowel sounds different in all three words (and the exact sounds may vary depend on your dialect of English). That is not the case with Quenya: the vowel <i>a</i> always sounds the same, and has more or less the same sound as in English “father”. The simplest way I’ve found to represent the sounds of the five Quenya vowels to English speakers (British or American pronunciation) is:</p>

<ul class="vocab-list">
<li><i>i</i> = “ee” as in “meet” or “mach<u>i</u>ne”</li>
<li><i>e</i> = “eh” as in “pet” or “guess”</li>
<li><i>a</i> = “ah” as in “f<u>a</u>ther” or “star”</li>
<li><i>o</i> = “oh” as in “thought” or “for”</li>
<li><i>u</i> = “oo” as in “goose” or “brute”</li>
</ul>

<p>The English “oh” is not an especially good representation of Quenya <i>o</i>, but I tend to use it in simplified charts like this for symmetry with other vowel sounds. The English vowel sounds in “thought” and “paw” are closer to Quenya <i>o</i>, and a pseudo-phonetic representation “aw” might be better. As an English speaker, though, I have difficulty distinguishing “aw” from “ah”, and so I tend to use “oh” for Quenya <i>o</i> instead. If you want to be more correct, use “aw” for <i>o</i> and pitch your Quenya <i>a</i> more towards the front of your mouth to make it more distinct, more like “bath” [a plainer “a”] than “father” [“ah”]. Depending on your dialect of English, these English “a” sounds can vary considerably, which makes it hard to describe things accurately in a written course.</p>

<p>If you happen to know it, the way Italian pronounces its five vowels <i>i, e, a, o, u</i> is close to Quenya pronunciation, so “pronounce Quenya vowels like in Italian” is a good rule of thumb. If you know IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) notation, the Quenya vowels are basically [i, ɛ, ä, ɔ, u]. I arrange the vowels in the order <i>i, e, a, o, u</i> because that is the sequence of the sounds from the front towards the back of the mouth. If you say “ee”, “eh”, “ah”, “oh”, “oo” in this order, you can feel the vowels move backwards as you speak.</p>

<p><a id="c2-1-1-2"></a><b>2.1.1.2 Pronunciation Before <i>r</i>:</b> English speakers have a tendency to “swallow” vowels before the letter “r”, and therefore they often mispronounce vowels in combination with <i>r</i> in Quenya (and other non-English languages). Quenya does not change the sound of vowels before <i>r</i> and Tolkien cautioned his readers about these mispronunciations, saying Quenya <i>er, ir</i> should be pronounced more like English “air, deer” and not as in “fern, fir”. The <i>r</i> should also be distinct and not swallowed; we will discuss the pronunciation of consonants in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-03.html">Chapter 3</a>.</p>

<p><a id="c2-1-1-3"></a><b>2.1.1.3 Long Vowels:</b> Long vowels in Quenya are marked with an accent <i>´</i>: <i>í, é, á, ó, ú</i>. In English, short and long vowels have different qualities: compare English “short a” to the English “long a” in words such as “made” and “say”. Technically “long vowels” in English are mostly diphthongs, a blending of two vowels (as discussed in the next section). This is not the case in Quenya, however, where the long vowels (mostly) have the same sound as the short vowels, but are simply held longer (about twice as long). This isn’t very natural for English speakers, so one trick I use to remind myself of this is to pronounce long vowels with “extra emphasis”. This generally works because the long vowel is frequently where the stress falls in Quenya (stress is discussed a bit further on).</p>

<p>Tolkien said the long <i>é</i> and <i>ó</i> were pronounced “tenser and closer” than short vowels, in IPA notation more like [eː, oː] versus short [ɛ, ɔ]. I find that level of accuracy a bit too much for beginners, but Tolkien gave us a cheat. He said there was “a fairly widespread [mis]pronunciation of long <i>é</i> and <i>ó</i> ... more or less as in English ‘say, no’, both in Westron and in the renderings of Quenya names by Westron speakers”. Coincidentally enough, these “Westron” pronunciations are how English speakers are likely to mispronounce these sounds, and they are part of the reason I feel justified in using “oh” as short hand for the pronunciation of Quenya <i>o</i>: it is at least the “official mispronunciation” of that sound. For beginners, I think the “ee, eh, ah, oh, oo” pronunciations are good enough, as well as being fairly easy to remember and distinguish.</p>

<p><a id="c2-1-1-4"></a><b>2.1.1.4 Example Pronunciations:</b> Using the above pseudo-phonetic English spelling, here are how some vocabulary words from the first chapter would be pronounced. These examples use “.” to mark syllable breaks and triple letters like “eee” or “ohh” to represent Quenya’s long vowels:</p>

<ul class="vocab-list">
<li><i>telumë</i> “roof”, pronounced “teh.loo.meh”</li>
<li><i>ambo</i> “hill”, pronounced “ahm.boh”</li>
<li><i>macil</i> “sword”, pronounced “mah.keel”</li>
<li><i>lúmë</i> “hour”, pronounced “looo.meh”</li>
<li><i>sí</i> “now”, pronounced “seee”</li>
<li><i>nóra</i> “is running”, pronounced “nohh.rah”</li>
</ul>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p><a id="c2-1-1-5"></a><b>2.1.1.5 How do we know this?</b> This discussion of Elvish vowel pronunciation is based on Appendix E of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, where Tolkien said the five vowel sounds were pronounced like “machine, were, father, for, brute”. The IPA notations [i, ɛ, ä, ɔ, u] are more or less the commonly accepted pronunciations of Quenya vowels (Quenya <i>a</i> varies from IPA [ä] to [ɑ]), but this is not necessarily how Tolkien himself pronounced them, since Tolkien was not a native speaker of Elvish. In his discussion of Quenya vowel sounds, Raccoon proposed an interesting alternate system based on Tolkien’s own pronunciation of Elvish words: see the discussion of the “Calabrian” system on <a href="https://feophan.github.io/tenguesta_ngoldorinwa/phon/sou/">https://feophan.github.io/tenguesta_ngoldorinwa/phon/sou/</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to hear recordings of Quenya pronunciations, Fiona Jallings has some sound files on her web site: see <a href="https://realelvish.net/pronunciation/quenya/">https://realelvish.net/pronunciation/quenya/</a>. Julian Bradfield has another Quenya pronunciation guide at <a href="https://tolklang.quettar.org/pronguide.html">https://tolklang.quettar.org/pronguide.html</a>, also with sound files.</p>

<h2><a id="c2-1-2"></a>2.1.2 Diphthongs</h2>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="#c2-1-2-1">2.1.2.1 Quenya Diphthongs</a></b></li>
<li><b><a href="#c2-1-2-2">2.1.2.2 Dieresis (¨)</a></b></li>

</ul>

<p>A diphthong is a combination of short vowels blended together in a single sound. English speakers are often unfamiliar with the concept of diphthongs, since the English system of “long vowels” is mostly diphthongs, so English speakers tend to incorrectly think of diphthongs as “long vowels” (frankly the English vowel system is a huge mess that makes it hard to teach English speakers the vowel systems of other languages). As mentioned previously, the English “long a” in “made” and “say” is actually a diphthong, a blending of the sounds “eh” and “ee” as in “EHee”. Try pronouncing these two short vowels as a single syllable rather than two, and you will get something very much like English “ay”.</p>

<p><a id="c2-1-2-1"></a><b>2.1.2.1 Quenya Diphthongs:</b> Quenya has six diphthongs, three <i>i</i>-diphthongs <i>ai, oi, ui</i> and three <i>u</i>-diphthongs <i>iu, eu, au</i>. All of these are blends of the relevant individual vowels: “AHee”, “OHee”, “OOee”; “eeOO”, “EHoo”, “AHoo”. Here are some English sounds that approximate these diphthongs:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>ai</i> = an “eye” sound as in English “eye” or “rye”. It is thus pronounced like the English “long i”  (“fight“, “pie” or “bite”) and <u>not</u> like the English “long a” (“fate”, “pay” or “bait”), which you might be tempted to use.</li>
<li><i>oi</i> = an “oy” sound as in “boy”, “coin” or “choice”. An English speaker’s intuition is generally correct with this diphthong.</li>
<li><i>ui</i> = a “wee” sound [roughly] similar to English “queen” or “linguine”, but as a [blended] falling diphthong  “OOee” with the emphasis on the first part, not a rising diphthong “ooEE”. Another possible example is English “ruin”, if you pronounce that word as one syllable instead of two.</li>
<li><i>iu</i> = a “yoo” sound as in “yule” or “music”. This is actually a rising diphthong in Quenya of the Third Age: “eeOO”. In classical Quenya pronunciation, it was falling “EEoo” like other Quenya diphthongs.</li>
<li><i>eu</i> = a “ehoo” sound [very roughly], a blend of “eh” and “oo” pronounced as a single syllable, for which there is no good English equivalent. To approximate it, try pronouncing English “mouse” as if the initial part of the sound was “meh”.</li>
<li><i>au</i> = an “ow” sound as in “how”, “loud” or “mouse”, and <u>not</u> like English “laud” or “awful”, which you might be tempted to use (the English “aw” sound is actually closer to Quenya <i>o</i>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Diphthongs make up a single syllable, so that Quenya <i>luinë</i> “blue” is two syllables rather than three, not “loo-ee-neh” but something like “lwee-neh” (but with emphasis on the “oo” part of the diphthong <i>ui</i> and not the “ee” part). Other than the six diphthongs above, vowel pairs are pronounced separately and make up two syllables. Hence <i>omentië</i> “meeting” has four syllables, pronounced “oh-mehn-tee-eh”.</p>

<p><a id="c2-1-2-2"></a><b>2.1.2.2 Dieresis (¨):</b> Tolkien often put a dieresis (¨) on top of some vowels like <i>ë</i> and <i>ö</i> to make it clear they are always pronounced separately. This course does so as well, but strictly speaking it is not necessary. Only the combinations <i>ai, oi, ui</i>; <i>iu, eu, au</i> are diphthongs (one syllable) and all other combinations are pronounced separately (two syllables), so there is rarely any ambiguity if you leave out the dieresis. The dieresis is also omitted in combinations like <i>uo</i> that English speakers already pronounce as two syllables. Most people (including Tolkien) omit the ¨ in more casual Quenya writing. Since this course is aimed at beginners, though, we will use the dieresis as appropriate throughout, but the student may omit it when (for example) writing answers to exercises.</p>

<p><a id="c2-1-2-3"></a><b>2.1.2.3 Example Pronunciations:</b> Here is a repeat of the pseudo-phonetic spelling of diphthongs from above:</p>

<ul class="vocab-list">
<li><i>ai</i> = “eye”</li>
<li><i>oi</i> = “oy”</li>
<li><i>ui</i> = “wee” [roughly]</li>
<li><i>iu</i> = “yoo”</li>
<li><i>eu</i> = “ehoo” [very roughly]</li>
<li><i>au</i> = “ow” (as in “how”, not “flow”)</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the above, here is how some of the vocabulary words from the first chapter (plus one new word) are pronounced:</p>

<ul class="vocab-list">
<li><i>aiwë</i> “bird”, pronounced “eye.weh”</li>
<li><i>oialë</i> “forever”, pronounced “oy.ah.leh”</li>
<li><i>luinë</i> “blue”, pronounced [roughly] “lwee.neh”</li>
<li><i>miuë</i> “cat”, pronounced “myoo.eh”</li>
<li><i>nauco</i> “dwarf”, pronounced “now.coh”</li>
<li><i>cöa</i> “house”, pronounced “coh.ah”</li>
</ul>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p><a id="c2-1-2-4"></a><b>2.1.2.4 How do we know this?</b> As with the previous section, this discussion of diphthongs is based on Appendix E of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, where Tolkien said <i>ai, oi, ui</i> are pronounced like “rye, boy, ruin” and <i>iu, au</i> like “yule, loud”. He also gave no English equivalent of <i>eu</i>, since there isn’t a good example. The example “ruin” is also not a great example, since as noted above its usual English pronunciation is as two syllables: “roo-in”. If you mash it into one syllable, though, it is a reasonable approximation of Quenya <i>ui</i>. Personally I tend to (mis)pronounce <i>ui</i> as the rising diphthong “wee” because it is easier for my English-trained mouth to form, but strictly speaking it is a falling diphthong: IPA <i>uı̯</i>. The only falling diphthong in Quenya is <i>iu</i> (“yoo”) and that is only the case in Third Age pronunciation: in the classical Quenya <i>iu</i> was also a rising diphthong.</p>

<h2><a id="c2-1-3"></a>2.1.3 Stress</h2>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="#c2-1-3-1">2.1.3.1 Quenya Stress</a></b></li>
<li><b><a href="#c2-1-3-2">2.1.3.2 Example Pronunciations</a></b></li>
<li class="advanced-topic"><b><a href="#c2-1-3-3">2.1.3.3 Advanced Topic: How do we know this?</a></b></li>
</ul>

<p><a id="c2-1-3-1"></a><b>2.1.3.1 Quenya Stress:</b> Both English and Quenya put stress on different syllables of a word. In this course, when describing stress in the context of pronunciation, the syllables are separated by “.” and stressed syllables are capitalized. For example: “de.SCRI.bing”, “pro.nun.ci.A.tion” and “SE.pa.rat.ed” are some stress representations of English words in the last sentence. Stress can be quite irregular in English, but in Quenya the rules are straightforward:</p>

<ol>
<li>Monosyllables are stressed on their only syllable, though sometimes minor monosyllables are unstressed within a larger phrase.</li>
<li>Disyllables are stressed on their first syllable.</li>
<li>Longer words are stressed on their second-to-last syllable if it is heavy, and otherwise their third-to-last syllable.</li>
</ol>

<p>To understand this last rule, you need to know the difference between a “light” and a “heavy” syllable. A light syllable is one that has a single short vowel followed by zero or one consonant. Any other syllable is heavy. In other words, a syllable is heavy if (a) it has a long vowel, (b) it has a diphthong or (c) it is followed by a cluster of two or more consonants. For example, consider the first syllable of the following Quenya words:</p>

<ul>
<li>Light: <i>tië</i> (<i>ti.ë</i>) “path”</li>
<li>Light: <i>tirë</i> (<i>ti.rë</i>) “watches”</li>
<li>Heavy: <i>tíra</i> (<i>tí.ra</i>) “is watching”</li>
<li>Heavy: <i>taurë</i> (<i>tau.rë</i>) “forest”</li>
<li>Heavy: <i>tirmo</i> (<i>tir.mo</i>) “watcher”</li>
</ul>

<p>Also remember that Quenya diphthongs (<i>ai, oi, ui</i>; <i>iu, eu, au</i>) make up one syllable, not two.</p>

<p><a id="c2-1-3-2"></a><b>2.1.3.2 Example Pronunciations:</b> For purposes of stress, a word with suffixes is treated as a single word (with some complications we will discuss in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-06.html">Chapter 6</a>). Since most of our vocabulary so far has been one or two syllables words, our interesting examples of stress will mostly involve inflected words (those with suffixes). Some examples, along with some pseudo-phonetic pronunciations using the system of the two previous sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>aiwë</i> “bird”, stressed <i>AI.wë</i>, pronounced “EYE.weh”</li>
<li><i>aiwëo</i> “of a bird”, stressed <i>AI.wë.o</i>, pronounced “EYE.weh.oh”</li>
<li><i>ambo</i> “hill”, stressed <i>AM.bo</i>, pronounced “AHM.boh”</li>
<li><i>ambonna</i> “to a hill”, stressed <i>am.BON.na</i>, pronounced “am.BOHN.na”</li>
<li><i>tíra</i> “is watching”, stressed <i>TÍ.ra</i>, pronounced “TEEE.rah”</li>
<li><i>tíranyë</i> “I am watching”, stressed <i>tí.RAN.yë</i>, pronounced “teee.RAHN.yeh”</li>
<li><i>tíranyes</i> “I am watching him/her”, stressed <i>tí.RAN.yes</i>, pronounced “teee.RAHN.yehs”</li>
<li><i>telumë</i> “roof”, stressed <i>TE.lu.më</i>, pronounced “TEH.loo.meh”</li>
<li><i>telumerya</i> “his roof”, stressed <i>te.lu.MER.ya</i>, pronounced “teh.loo.MEHR.yah”</li>
<li><i>telumeryallo</i> “from his roof”, stressed <i>te.lu.mer.YAL.lo</i>, pronounced “teh.loo.mehr.YAHL.loh”</li>
</ul>

<p>The syllabic breakdown for pronunciation usually doesn’t match the grammatical elements of a word: compare <i>tí.RAN.yes</i> vs. <i>tíra-nye-s</i> = “(am watching)-I-him/her”. As syllabic suffixes are added to a word, the stress may or may not shift, depending on the nature of the suffix: <i>aiwë</i> (<i>AI.wë</i>) → <i>aiwëo</i> (<i>AI.wë.o</i>) vs. <i>ambo</i> (<i>AM.bo</i>) → <i>ambonna</i> (<i>am.BON.na</i>). That can lead to some complex situations, but we are going to put off discussing the messier cases until <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-06.html">Chapter 6</a>.</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p><a id="c2-1-3-3"></a><b>2.1.3.3 How do we know this?</b> As with previous sections, this is all straight out of Appendix E. The Quenya stress examples Tolkien gave were: <i>is.IL.dur, O.ro.më, er.ES.së.a, an.CA.li.ma, el.en.TÁ.ri, an.DÚ.ne</i>.</p>
</div>

<h2><a id="c2-1-4"></a>2.1.4 Vocabulary: Places</h2>

<p>Here is a vocabulary list of nouns having to do with places which we will use for further practice. Some words are repeats from the first chapter.</p>

<ul class="vocab-list">
<li><b>ailin</b> <i>n.</i> “lake”</li>
<li><b>Ambar</b> <i>n.</i> “World”</li>
<li><b>ambo</b> <i>n.</i> “hill”</li>
<li><b>Endóre</b> <i>n.</i> “Middle-earth”</li>
<li><b>nan(do)</b> <i>n.</i> “valley”</li>
<li><b>oron</b> (<b>oront-</b>) <i>n.</i> “mountain”</li>
<li><b>mindon</b> <i>n.</i> “tower”</li>
<li><b>noirë</b> <i>n.</i> “tomb”</li>
<li><b>nór</b> <i>n.</i> “(dry) land” ¹</li>
<li><b>nórë</b> <i>n.</i> “country, land, nation” ¹</li>
<li><b>opelë</b> <i>n.</i> “village”</li>
<li><b>osto</b> <i>n.</i> “city”</li>
<li><b>sírë</b> (<b>siri-</b>) <i>n.</i> “river”</li>
<li><b>rotto</b> <i>n.</i> “cave, tunnel”</li>
<li><b>taurë</b> <i>n.</i> “forest”</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Note ¹: <i>nór</i> is “dry land” as opposed to the “water” or “sea” (WJ/413), which are respectively <i>nén</i> (“water”) and <i>ëar</i> (“sea”). <i>Nór</i> is related to but distinct from <i>nórë</i> which is a “land” in the sense of a country or nation where people live.</li>
<li class="advanced-topic">If you wondering what (WJ/413) means, that is the notation this course uses for a reference to original source material: it means <i>War of the Jewels</i> p. 413. See <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-01.html#c1-3">Chapter 1</a> for an explanation of the reference notation used in this course, along with a list of the major reference books. For the beginning student, these references can be considered an “advanced topic” and ignored for now, until you know enough to start reading Tolkien’s own writings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Several of the items in the list above have parenthetical variants. For example word <i>nan(do)</i> “valley” has two variants: short <i>nan</i> and long <i>nando</i>. With such variants the long forms tend to be used in normal contexts, and the short forms in things like compounds, such as <i>Tasarinan</i> “Willow-vale” (LotR/469). Other words have separate stem form listed after the word: <i>oron</i> (<i>oront-</i>) “mountain” or <i>sírë</i> (<i>siri-</i>) “river”. The first form is used when no suffixes are added (the uninflected form), but the second form is used with suffixes (inflected forms). Hence uninflected <i>oron</i> “a mountain” but inflected <i>oronto</i> “of a mountain” or <i>orontello</i> “from a mountain”.</p>

<p>Stem forms can have a big effect on stress. Compare <i>ailino</i> (<i>AI.lin.o</i>) “of a lake” where the stress remains on the first syllable vs. <i>oronto</i> (<i>o.RON.to</i>) “of a mountain” where the stress moves back to the second syllable. Stems forms will be discussed in more detail in <a href="#c2-4">Section 2.4 Reading Vocabulary Entries</a>.</p>

<p><a id="c2-1-5-1"></a><b>2.1.5.1 Vowel Pronunciation Summary:</b> Here are English pseudo-phonetic representations of Quenya vowels and diphthongs:</p>

<ul class="vocab-list">

<li><i>e</i> = “eh” as in “guess”</li>
<li><i>a</i> = “ah” as in “father”</li>

<p>Quenya long vowels (<i>í, é, á, ó, ú</i>) have basically the same sound but are held longer, represented pseudo-phonetically by “eee, ehh, ahh, ohh, ooo”.</p>
<p>Alternately (and somewhat more accurately), you may pronounce Quenya <i>a</i> = “a” as in “bath” and Quenya <i>o</i> = “aw” as in “thought” or “paw”. However, I find the “ee, eh, ah, oh, oo” pronunciations to be easier to remember and distinguish for English speakers, and recommend it to beginners for this reason. If you really want to know how to pronounce Quenya, there is only so much you can get from a written course, so I recommend checking out the advanced topics section at the end of <a href="#c2-1-1-4">Section 2.1.1</a> which has links to online sound recordings.</p>

<li>Monosyllables are stressed on their only syllable, though sometimes minor monosyllables are unstressed within a larger phrase.</li>
<li>Disyllables are stressed on their first syllable.</li>
<li>Longer words are stressed on their second-to-last syllable if it is heavy, and otherwise their third-to-last syllable.
<ul>
<li>A syllable is heavy if (a) it has a long vowel, (b) it has a diphthong or (c) it is followed by a cluster of two or more consonants.</li>

<h2><a id="c2-2-1"></a>2.2.1 Major Verb Classes</h2>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="#c2-2-1-1">2.2.1.1 Basic Verbs</a></b></li>
<li><b><a href="#c2-2-1-2">2.2.1.2 A-stem Verbs</a></b></li>

</ul>

<p>Quenya verbs can be divided into three major groups: basic verbs, a-stem verbs and u-stem verbs. Here is a mix of verbs to illustrate these verbs classes:</p>

<ul class="vocab-list">
<li><b>celu-</b> <i>v.</i> “to flow (forth)”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> <b>celunë</b> “flowed”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>fara-</b> <i>v.</i> “to hunt”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> <b>faranë</b> “hunted”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>har-</b> <i>v.</i> “to sit, stay”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> ^<b>handë</b> “sat, stayed”</li></ul></li>
<li>^<b>haru-</b> <i>v.</i> “to sit down”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> *<b>harunë</b> “sat down”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>lelya-</b> <i>v.</i> “to travel”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> <b>lendë</b> “traveled”</li></ul></li>
<li>#<b>tar-</b> <i>v.</i> “to stand”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> <b>tarnë</b> “stood”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>tolu-</b> <i>v.</i> “to stand up”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> *<b>tolunë</b> “stood up”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>tul-</b> <i>v.</i> “to come”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> <b>túlë</b> “came”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>caita-</b> <i>v.</i> “to lie (down)”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> *<b>cainë</b> “lay”</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>A few notes on the vocabulary list above:</p>

<ol>
<li>As usual, vocabulary entries for verbs list their stem form (with a dash “-”) to which inflections are added. You can tell a verb’s group from its stem:
<ul>
<li><b>Basic:</b> End in a consonant like <i>har-, tar-</i>.</li>
<li><b>A-stem:</b> End in the vowel <i>a</i> like <i>fara-, lelya-</i>.</li>
<li><b>U-stem:</b> End in the vowel <i>u</i> like <i>celu-, tolu-</i>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Starting with this chapter, we are going to include the past tense (<i>pa.t.</i>) in all vocabulary entries for verbs. Quenya past tenses can be quite irregular, and it is best for beginners to just memorize their forms. This will be discussion further in <a href="#c2-2-4">Section 2.2.4 Introduction to the Past Tense</a>.</li>
<li>This vocabulary list includes various “reliability markers” that indicate the level of knowledge about a particular word, inflected form or English translation.
<ul>
<li>Unmarked items are attested, which mean they appear somewhere in Tolkien’s writing.</li>
<li># items only appear in an inflected form, with base word extracted from that inflection.</li>
<li>* items do not appear directly, but are deducible from other forms or aspects of the language.</li>
<li>^ items are adapted from rejected or earlier forms of the language.</li>
<li>? items are educated guesses based on other materials [no examples in the list above].</li>
<li>! items are fan-invented forms, also called neologisms = new words [no examples in the list above].</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>These markers will be discussed in detail in <a href="#c2-4">Section 2.4 Reading Vocabulary Entries</a>.</p>

<p><a id="c2-2-1-1"></a><b>2.2.1.1 Basic Verbs:</b> The most straightforward verb class, these verbs all date back to some ancient verbal root. In this respect, they are the most primal verbs. Despite the name “basic”, they tend to have more complex tense formations, so they are basic in their meaning but not in their conjugation.</p>

<p><a id="c2-2-1-2"></a><b>2.2.1.2 A-stem Verbs:</b> A-stem verbs involve the addition of a suffix to some ancient base form, which may or may not be a verbal root. For the a-stem verbs, these suffixes end in the vowel <i>a</i> (with some complexities we will discuss in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-08.html">Chapter 8</a>). The verb tenses for most a-stems verbs are similar, especially in the aorist and present tenses. However, there are several “hidden verb classes” within this larger group, meaning there are several exceptions that we will discuss latter in the course. Because they represent such a large group, a-stem verbs have a variety of meanings.</p>

<p><a id="c2-2-1-3"></a><b>2.2.1.3 U-stem Verbs:</b> The u-stem verbs are formed from a similar derivational process, but their verb stems all end in <i>u</i>. They are much rarer than the a-stem verbs. Many u-stem verbs have an inceptive function, which means they indicate the start of an action. Compare the basic verb <i>har-</i> “sit” vs. <i>haru-</i> “sit down” = “begin to sit”, and basic <i>tar-</i> “stand” vs. <i>tolu-</i> “stand up” = “begin to stand” (from a different verbal root). There are exceptions such as <i>celu-</i> “to flow”, though given its similarity to other u-stem verbs it often has the sense “flow forth” = “start to flow”.</p>

<p><a id="c2-2-1-4"></a><b>2.2.1.4 The Base Vowel:</b> For many verb conjugations, it is important to identify the base vowel of the verb: its first vowel, ignoring any prefixes. Here are some verbs with base vowels underlined:</p>

<ul class="vocab-list">
<li><b>f<u>a</u>ra-</b> “to hunt”
<li><b>l<u>e</u>lya-</b> “to travel”
<li><b>t<u>a</u>r-</b> “to stand”
<li><b>t<u>o</u>lu-</b> “to stand up”
<li><b>t<u>u</u>l-</b> “to come”
<li><b>c<u>a</u>ita-</b> “to lie (down)”
</ul>

<p>The addition of a prefix does not change the base vowel of a verb. For example, with the prefixed verb <i>entul-</i> “to return, come again” (= <i>en-</i> “again” + <i>tul-</i> “come”) the base vowel still remains <i>u</i>: <i>ent<u>u</u>l-</i>.</p>

<p>The base vowel is important because it is modified in several verb tenses. For example, it is lengthened in the present tense: <i>túla-</i> “is coming”, <i>entúla-</i> “is coming again”. Similarly, the perfect tense of basic verbs (a) adds the base vowel as a prefix if possible, (b) lengthens the base vowel and (c) adds the suffix <i>-ië</i>: <i>utúlië</i> “has come”, <i>entúlië</i> “has returned”.</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p><a id="c2-2-1-5"></a><b>2.2.1.5 How do we know this?</b> This presentation of verb classes is descriptive: it represents an analysis of Tolkien’s use of verbs in various documents not specifically about verbs themselves. As such it is a simplified view of Quenya verbs dating back to the early 2000s, and many Quenya courses organize verbs into these three groups. However, the publication of <i>Parma Eldalamberon #22</i> (PE22) in 2015 included a number of previously unknown documents on Quenya verbs, which significantly expanded our knowledge of how Quenya verbs behave. In particular, it indicated there were a lot more verb classes than these basic three, the “hidden verb classes” mentioned above.</p>

<p>For educational purposes, though, this simplified view of Quenya verbs is very useful. It lets you learn the basics of Quenya verb conjugation without getting bogged down in too many details on the more obscure verb classes. For now, the variations for these more specialized verb classes will be treated as exceptions to normal conjugations, and are discussed in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-08.html">Chapter 8</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="c2-2-2"></a>2.2.2 The Aorist Tense</h2>

<li class="advanced-topic"><b><a href="#c2-2-2-3">2.2.2.3 Advanced Topic: Historic Origin of the Aorist</a></b></li>
</ul>

<p><a id="c2-2-2-1"></a><b>2.2.2.1 The Use of the Aorist:</b> The aorist verb tense is not specifically associated with the past, present or future. You might even think of it as the “no tense” tense, since it does not mark the verb for any particular time. As Tolkien described it:</p>

<blockquote>This “tense” actually defined no tense or time. Its uses most closely resembled those of the simple present of English: “I eat, I do”. It was thus used of all statements true at all times (as in proverbs): “gold glitters”; “the sun rises in the morning”. It is also used of habitual actions: “I walk to my work”, “I sleep badly at night” (PE22/129).</blockquote>

<p>As noted here, the aorist serves a function similar to English’s simple present: <i>matë</i> = “eats”. Three basic uses of the aorist are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Statements that are true at all times: <i>malta alca</i> “gold glitters (<i>alca-</i>)”.</li>
<li>Statements that span past, present and future: <i>melis verurya</i> “she loves (<i>mel-</i>) her husband”.</li>
<li>Statements that represent a repeated or habitual action: <i>lorin lómessë</i> “I sleep (<i>lor-</i>) at night”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like the English simple present, the aorist can also be used with adverbs of time to serve as a replacement for other tenses: <i>yestas sí</i> “he/she starts (<i>yesta-</i>) now” (present) or <i>yestas enar</i> “he/she starts tomorrow” (future). Unlike English, this can also be done with adverbs of the past: <i>yestas nöa</i> “he/she starts yesterday” (past). This use with past adverbs doesn’t work in English, because the English simple present is really a “not past” tense, but it works in Quenya because the aorist is genuinely timeless. This use of the aorist with temporal adverbs is rare, however, and usually Quenya employs its past, present or future tenses. In particular, we won’t use the aorist this way in any of the exercises for this course.</p>

<p><a id="c2-2-2-2"></a><b>2.2.2.2 Aorist Conjugations:</b> Here is how the aorist is conjugated for our three major groups of verbs:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Basic:</b> Add an <i>–ë</i> to the stem, or <i>i</i> with further inflections.
<ul>
<li><i>mat-</i> “to eat”: <i>i atan matë</i> “the man eats”, <i>i atani matir</i> “the men eat” (<i>mat-i-r</i>), <i>matin</i> “I eat” (<i>mat-i-n</i>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>A-stem:</b> Use the stem unmodified, to which further inflections are added.
<ul>
<li><i>lelya-</i> “to travel”: <i>i atan lelya</i> “the man travels”, <i>i atani lelyar</i> “the men travel” (<i>lelya-r</i>), <i>lelyan</i> “I travel” (<i>lelya-n</i>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>U-stem:</b> Use the stem unmodified, to which further inflections are added.
<ul>
<li><i>celu-</i> “to flow”: <i>i sírë celu</i> “the river flows”, <i>i síri celur</i> “the rivers flow” (<i>celu-r</i>), <i>celus</i> “It flows” (<i>celu-s</i>).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p><a id="c2-2-2-3"></a><b>2.2.2.3 Historic Origin of the Aorist:</b> The somewhat mysterious change of <i>ë</i> to <i>i</i> in the aorist tense of basics verbs makes more sense if you know how the aorist tense originated. In the ancient aorist, the suffix was always <i>i</i>, but in Quenya’s phonetic evolution, a short final <i>i</i> became <i>e</i> (PE22/99). Thus the ancient aorist ✶<i>mati</i> “eat” became in modern Quenya <i>matë</i>. This changed did not occur when inflections were added, because the short <i>i</i> was not final, so ancient ✶<i>mati-n(i)</i> became modern <i>matin</i> “I eat”.</p>
<p>It is pretty clear that Quenya’s aorist was inspired by the aorist tense of Ancient Greek, especially since Tolkien used the same name for the Quenya tense. The aorist has been well understand for quite a while, since it is a verb tense that is both common and fairly straightforward. Some detailed explanations of the aorist were published in <i>Parma Eldalamberon #22</i> (PE22), which had several important documents on verbs, including the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> written by Tolkien 1948 (PE22/99-127) and <i>Common Eldarin Verb Structure</i> written in the early 1950s (PE22/128-140). This course makes regular use of information from these two documents in its discussion of Quenya verbs.</p>

<h2><a id="c2-2-3"></a>2.2.3 The Present Tense</h2>

<ul>

<li><b><a href="#c2-2-3-2">2.2.3.2 Present Tense Conjugations</a></b></li>
<li class="advanced-topic"><b><a href="#c2-2-3-3">2.2.3.3 Advanced Topic: Historic Origin of the Present Tense</a></b></li>
</ul>

<p><a id="c2-2-3-1"></a><b>2.2.3.1 The Use of the Present Tense:</b> The present tense is, like its name suggests, used to describe things that are happening <u>now</u>, or at least “now” within the context of the discourse. As Tolkien described it:</p>

<blockquote>Present. This is a genuine tense, and can only be used of what is happening now, or of what is regarded as “now” in narrative or supposition. This tense also as a rule describes a fairly continuous action or event or process, that began before the immediate moment and is likely to go on for some time (PE22/130).</blockquote>

<p>Since the present is ever moving, an action can only occur in the present tense if it is an ongoing action, otherwise it would be in the past as soon as it was spoken of. This makes the Quenya present the equivalent of the English present continuous tense, which likewise describes an ongoing action: <i>máta</i> = “is eating”. The English simple present can also be use for the present time, however, and in some cases the Quenya present tense can be translated into the English simple present, as in Frodo’s greeting <i>elen <u>síla</u> lumenna’ omentielvo</i> “a star <u>shines</u> (<i>sil-</i>) on the hour of our meeting” (LotR/81).</p>

<p>The reverse is not true when translating from English to Quenya. Where you see an English present continuous verb (“I am eating”) you must use the Quenya present tense (<i>mátan</i>), because only that tense includes the notion of an ongoing action. In linguistics, verbs describing an ongoing or incomplete action are called “imperfect”, as opposed to the “perfect” for a completed action. Thus in some respects the Quenya present tense (ongoing) is the opposite of the Quenya perfect tense (complete) that we will discuss in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-05.html">Chapter 5</a>.</p>

<p>For clarity, the exercises of this course always translate the Quenya aorist tense using the English simple present (<i>matë</i> = “eats”) and the Quenya present tense using the English present continuous (<i>máta</i> = “is eating”), and vice versa.</p>

<p><a id="c2-2-3-2"></a><b>2.2.3.2 Present Tense Conjugations:</b> Here is how the present tense is conjugated for our three major groups of verbs. Recall that the “base vowel” of the verb is the first vowel of that verb, ignoring any prefixes:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Basic:</b> Lengthen the base vowel and add an <i>–a</i> to the stem, then add any inflections.
<ul>
<li><i>mat-</i> “to eat”: <i>i atan máta</i> “the man is eating”, <i>i atani mátar</i> “the men are eating” (<i>máta-r</i>), <i>mátan</i> “I eat” (<i>máta-n</i>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>A-stem:</b> Lengthen the base vowel (if possible) and change the final <i>–a</i> to <i>-ëa</i>, then add any inflections.
<ul>
<li><i>fara-</i> “to hunt”: <i>i atan fárëa</i> “the man is hunting”, <i>i atani fárëa</i> “the men are hunting” (<i>fárëa-r</i>), <i>fárëan</i> “I am hunting” (<i>fárëa-n</i>).</li>
<li><i>lelya-</i> “to travel”: <i>i atan lelyëa</i> “the man is travelling”, <i>i atani lelyëar</i> “the men are travelling” (<i>lelyëa-r</i>), <i>lelyëan</i> “I am travelling” (<i>lelyëa-n</i>).</li>
<li><i>caita-</i> “to lie (down)”: <i>i atan caitëa</i> “the man is lying (down)”, <i>i atani caitëar</i> “the men are lying (down)” (<i>caitëa-r</i>), <i>caitëan</i> “I am lying (down)” (<i>caitëa-n</i>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>U-stem:</b> Lengthen the base vowel (if possible) and add an <i>–a</i> to the stem, then add any inflections.
<ul>
<li><i>celu-</i> “to flow”: <i>i sírë célua</i> “the river is flowing”, <i>i síri céluar</i> “the rivers are flowing” (<i>célua-r</i>), <i>céluas</i> “it is flowing” (<i>célua-s</i>).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>One complication with the present tense is that Quenya does not tolerate long vowels before consonant clusters. Thus the present tense only lengthens the base vowel of the verb if that vowel does not appear before a consonant clusters. Likewise, if the base vowel is part of a diphthong, that vowel cannot be lengthened. It is common for a-stem verbs to have a consonant cluster or a diphthong, so for these verbs the present tense is marked only by the change of final <i>-a</i> to <i>-ëa</i>. Compare <i>fárëa</i> “is hunting” (lengthening possible) to <i>lelyëa</i> “is travelling” and <i>caitëa</i> “is lying down” (lengthening not possible).</p>

<p><a id="c2-2-3-3"></a><b>2.2.3.3 Historic Origin of the Present Tense:</b> For basic verbs and u-stem verbs, the basic formation of the present tense dates back to the ancient form of the language: lengthen the base vowel and add an <i>-a</i> to the stem, as described by Tolkien in <i>Common Eldarin Verb Structure</i> in the early 1950s (PE22/136). In the case of a-stem verbs, their ancient forms frequently already ended in <i>a</i>, so the suffix was <i>-ya</i> instead of plain <i>-a</i> so that the ancient present tense form ended in <i>-aya</i>, as indicated in various notes from the mid-to-late 1960s (PE17/186, PE22/164). In Quenya’s phonetic history, the combination <i>aya</i> often developed into <i>ëa</i>, thus forming the basic for the modern present tense for a-stem verbs.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, there are a number of “hidden verb classes” within the a-stem verbs, and their historical present tense forms were not all the same. In <i>Late Notes on Verb Structure</i> from 1969, Tolkien said something like “make Q. <i>ea</i> as present tense invade other forms” in a hard-to-read note (PE22/164). This indicates that many (all?) of the alternate present tense formations for more specialized verb classes were displaced by the <i>-ëa</i> present, which became the usual way of forming the present for a-stem verbs in Quenya. For now, we will use the <i>-ëa</i> present suffix for all a-stem verbs. The alternate (and possibly archaic) present tense forms of more specialized verb classes will be discussed in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-08.html">Chapter 8</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="c2-2-4"></a>2.2.4 Introduction to the Past Tense</h2>

<p>The Quenya past is, obviously enough, used to describe events in the past: <i>i atan mantë</i> “the man ate”, <i>manten</i> “I ate”. The Quenya past tense is very irregular, though. Different verb classes form the past tense in various ways, and there were competing methods of past tense formation in the ancient form of the language producing a variety of results in modern Quenya. It is often impossible to determine the past tense of a Quenya verb from just its verb stem. Here are the past tense forms of the verbs introduced in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-01.html#c1-2-2">Chapter 1</a>:</p>

<ul class="vocab-list">
<li><b>cir-</b> <i>v.</i> “to cut”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> *<b>cirnë</b> “cut”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>lor-</b> <i>v.</i> “to sleep”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> *<b>lornë</b> “slept”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>mat-</b> <i>v.</i> “to eat”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> <b>mantë</b> “ate”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>men-</b> <i>v.</i> “to go”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> <b>mennë</b> “went”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>nor-</b> <i>v.</i> “to run”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> <b>nornë</b> “ran”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>sam-</b> <i>v.</i> “to have”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> <b>sámë</b> “had”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>sil-</b> <i>v.</i> “to shine (white)”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> ?<b>sillë</b> “shone (white)”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>tir-</b> <i>v.</i> “to watch”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> <b>tirnë</b> “watched”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>tuv-</b> <i>v.</i> “to find, discover”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> ^<b>túvë</b> “found, discovered”</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>In the list above we see more “reliability markers” as mentioned in previous sections: ^ for past forms adapted from earlier or rejected writings, * for past forms that are readily derived from what we know about the Quenya language (which are relatively safe), and ? for past forms that are educated guesses (which are a bit dubious). The unmarked past forms were provided by Tolkien. In some cases we just don’t know what the past tense of a given Quenya verb is, because Tolkien never wrote it down and didn’t give us enough information to figure it out.</p>

<p>The Quenya past is irregular, but this is not to say there are <u>no</u> rules to the Quenya past tense. For example, the suffix <i>-në</i> shows up a lot in Quenya past term forms, the same way that the suffix “-ed” shows up in a lot of English past tenses. However, there are too many rules for the Quenya past tense to cover at this stage of the course. For now, treat every verb entry as two vocabulary items, one for its stem and another for its past tense, and memorize both. If you feel this unreasonable, just look at the English past forms above, which are also very unpredictable. The pain you suffer in learning the Quenya past tense is the same pain as thousands of English-as-a-second-language students, and that’s just the way things go sometimes when learning a foreign language.</p>

<p>Once you know the past form, the regular verb inflections are added to that form:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>mat-</i> “to eat”: <i>i atan mantë</i> “the man ate”, <i>i atani manter</i> “the men ate”, <i>manten</i> “I ate”.</li>
<li><i>lelya-</i> “to travel”: <i>i atan lendë</i> “the man travelled”, <i>i atani lender</i> “the men travelled”, <i>lenden</i> “I travelled”.</li>
<li><i>celu-</i> “to flow”: <i>i sírë celunë</i> “the river flowed”, <i>i síri celuner</i> “the rivers flowed”, <i>celunes</i> “it flowed”.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="c2-2-5-1"></a><b>2.2.5.1 Verbs of Movement:</b> Of the various movement verbs, <i>men-</i> (“go”) is the most generic, and simply means going in some direction. The verb <i>tul-</i> means movement towards the speaker (“come”) and <i>auta-</i> means movement away from the speaker (“go away, depart”). The verb <i>lelya-</i> has the implication of a longer journey (“travel”) and <i>anya-</i> is for the end of a journey (“arrive”). The verb <i>menta-</i> mean directing someone to go (“send = cause to go”), while <i>tulta-</i> means directing someone to come toward the speaker (“send for = cause to come”). Finally <i>tulya-</i> means speaker is taking someone with them (“bring”), with the secondary implication that the speaker is leading them on the journey; it does <u>not</u> mean “lead” in a political sense.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>men-</i> “to go”: <i>i atan menë</i> “the man goes”, <i>i atan ména</i> “the man is going”, <i>i atan mennë</i> “the man went” (generally, in an unspecified direction).</li>
<li><i>tul-</i> “to come”: <i>i atan tulë</i> “the man comes”, <i>i atan túla</i> “the man is coming”, <i>i atan túlë</i> “the man came”.</li>
<li><i>auta-</i> “to go away, depart”: <i>i atan auta</i> “the man departs”, <i>i atan autëa</i> “the man is departing”, <i>i atan vánë</i> “the man departed”.</li>
<li><i>anya-</i> “to arrive”: <i>i atan anya</i> “the man arrives”, <i>i atan anyëa</i> “the man is arriving”, <i>i atan ananyë</i> “the man arrived”.</li>

</ul>

<p><a id="c2-2-5-2"></a><b>2.2.5.2 Verbs of Location:</b> The other verbs in the above list have to do with being in a particular location. The verbs <i>har-</i>/<i>haru-</i> and <i>tar-</i>/<i>tolu-</i> are in pairs: <i>har-</i> “to sit” vs. <i>haru-</i> “sit down” (= begin to sit); <i>tar-</i> “to stand” vs. <i>tolu-</i> “stand up” (= begin to stand); the forms of <i>tar-</i> and <i>tolu-</i> are more distinct because they are based on different verbal roots (TAR “stand” and TOL “stick up”). The verb <i>har-</i> “sit” and <i>tar-</i> “stand” can also applied to geographic features as appropriate based on verticality: <i>i osto harë</i> “the city sits” but <i>i oron tarë</i> “the mountain stands”. Flat geographic features use the verb <i>lat-</i> “extend, be situated”, which basically means “lie” but used only of places: <i>i sírë latë ara i ambo</i> “the river lies (is situated) beside the hill”. The other Quenya verb for “lie” is <i>caita-</i> “lie (down)” which is not used for places but rather for one thing lying on another: <i>i atan caita</i> “the man lies (down)”. It is mostly used of lying people and animals, though it can be used of a thing lying on another thing as well.</p>

<p>The verb <i>har-</i> means “stay” as well as “sit”, so if an Elf says <i>á harë mecin</i> “sit/stay please”, they are probably asking you to stay for a while. If they want you to sit down, they would say <i>á haru mecin</i> “sit down please” (these are imperative phrases, which will be discussed in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-03.html">Chapter 3</a>). The verb <i>ser-</i> means “rest”, but it can also be used in the sense of “stay for a time” = “tarry”: <i>i atan séra i tauressë</i> “the man rests/tarries in the forest”. For someone staying or dwelling in a place more permanently, the correct verb is <i>mar-</i> “dwell, abide, live”: <i>i atan marë i ostossë</i> “the man dwells/lives in the city”. The verb <i>mar-</i> only means “live” in the sense “live in a place”; the general verb for being alive is <i>coita-</i>: <i>eldar coitar anda</i> “Elves live long (= for a long time)”.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>har-</i> “to sit, stay”: <i>i atan harë</i> “the man sits/stays”, <i>i atan hára</i> “the man is sitting/staying”, <i>i atan handë</i> “the man sat/stayed”.</li>
<li><i>haru-</i> “to sit down”: <i>i atan haru</i> “the man sits down”, <i>i atan hárua</i> “the man is sitting down”, <i>i atan harunë</i> “the man sat down”.</li>
<li><i>tar-</i> “to stand”: <i>i atan tarë</i> “the man stands”, <i>i atan tára</i> “the man is standing”, <i>i atan tarnë</i> “the man stood”.</li>
<li><i>tolu-</i> “to stand up”: <i>i atan tolu</i> “the man stands up”, <i>i atan tólua</i> “the man stands up”, <i>i atan tolunë</i> “the man stood up”.</li>
<li><i>lat-</i> “to lie, be situated”: <i>i sírë latë</i> “the river lies”, <i>i sírë láta</i> “the river is lying”, <i>i sírë lantë</i> “the river lay”.</li>
<li><i>caita-</i> “to lie (down)”: <i>i atan caita</i> “the man lies (down)”, <i>i atan caitëa</i> “the man is lying (down)”, <i>i atan cainë</i> “the man lay (down)”.</li>
<li><i>ser-</i> “to rest, tarry”: <i>i atan serë</i> “the man rests/tarries”, <i>i atan séra</i> “the man is resting/tarrying”, <i>i atan sendë</i> “the man rested/tarried”.</li>
<li><i>mar-</i> “to live, dwell”: <i>i atan marë</i> “the man dwells”, <i>i atan mára</i> “the man is dwelling”, <i>i atan marnë</i> “the man dwelled”.</li>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p>The above discussion for verbs of location is mostly based on notes in the <i>Quenya Verbal System</i> written in 1948 (PE22/125-126). However several of the verbs in those notes used earlier and abandoned forms, such <i>ham-</i> “sit” instead of later <i>har-</i> “sit” from the 1960s (PE17/162; UT/305). In the discussion for this course, some of the abandoned verbs from 1948 have been updated to their later forms from the 1950s and 60s.</p>

<p>Most languages have at least one verb with a meaning like “to be”: Latin “esse”, Arabic “kāna”, and Japanese “desu” or “aru/iru”. Quenya has two different verbs where English might use the verb “be”: <i>ná-</i> “to be” and <i>eä-</i> “to exist”. The verb “to be” tends to very specialized in differnt languages, and the way that Quenya uses its “to be” verbs is not the same as how English uses them.</p>

<p><a id="c2-3-1-1"></a><b>2.3.1.1 Usage of <i>ná-</i>:</b> As Tolkien described it, <i>ná</i> “join[s] adjs./nouns/pronouns in statements (or wishes) asserting (or desiring) a thing to have a certain quality, or to be the same as another” (PE22/147). It is thus used like the English verb “be” to equate two things: a noun to another noun, a pronoun to a noun or a (pro)noun to an adjective. In this last case, the statement asserts that the (pro)noun has the quality of that adjective:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>i nauco (ná) hesto</i> “the dwarf is a captain”.</li>
<li><i>nanyë elda</i> “I am an elf”; <i>na-nyë</i> = “am-I”.</li>
<li><i>i atan (ná) halla</i> “the man is tall”.</li>
<li><i>nalyë turca</i> “you are strong”; <i>na-lyë</i> = “are-you”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The parenthesis in the sentences above indicates where the use of <i>ná</i> is optional. In sentences where <i>ná</i> carries no additional information, it is usually omitted: <i>i nauco hesto</i> “the dwarf [is] a captain”, <i>i atan turca</i> “the man [is] strong”. If, however, the verb <i>ná</i> carries a pronominal suffix or a verb tense, it becomes required: <i>nás turca</i> “he is strong”, <i>i atan nánë turca</i> “the man was strong”. Without <i>ná</i>, there is nothing for the pronoun or verb tense to attach to. The verb <i>ná</i> is also required when it is used impersonally, without an explicit subject: <i>ná mára</i> “[it] is good” (PE17/93).</p>

<p><a id="c2-3-1-2"></a><b>2.3.1.2 <i>ná-</i> Conjugations:</b> Here is how <i>ná-</i> is conjugated in the major Quenya verb tenses:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Aorist/present:</b> <i>ná</i> “is/am/are”</li>
<li><b>Future:</b> <i>nauva</i> “will be”</li>
<li><b>Past:</b> <i>nánë</i> “was/were”</li>
<li><b>Perfect:</b> <i>anaië</i> “has/have been”</li>
</ul>

<p>We haven’t fully discussed the future and perfect tenses yet, but their meaning should be clear. The verb <i>ná-</i> is somewhat unusual in that it doesn’t distinguish between the aorist and present tenses; the simple stem <i>ná</i> is used for both timeless statements and statements about the present.</p>

<p>The present/aorist form <i>ná</i> is so short that it usually uses long subject suffix like <i>-nyë</i> and <i>-lyë</i>, in which case the vowel shortens: <i>nanyë</i> “I am”, <i>nalyë</i> “you are”. The main exception is <i>nás</i> “he/she/it is”, which typically uses the short suffix and the long vowel. With future, past and perfect tenses, the short pronoun suffixes again become more common: <i>nauvan</i> “I will be”, <i>nánel</i> “you were”, <i>anaies</i> “he/she/it has been”.</p>

<p>The verb <i>ná</i> can be used impersonally (without a subject) when describing general circumstances. Compare:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>ná mára</i> “it is good” (not referring to anything in particular)</li>
<li><i>nás mára</i> “it (that specific thing) is good” [or alternately “he/she is good”]</li>
</ul>

<p>If you say <i>ná lauca</i> “it is warm”, you mean that the environment is warm. If you say <i>nás lauca</i> “he/she/it is warm”, you mean the thing under discussion is warm. For these impersonal expressions, it is more common for the <i>ná</i> to be placed second: <i>mára ná</i> “it is good”, <i>lauca ná</i> “it is warm”, as discussed in the next section.</p>

<p><a id="c2-3-1-3"></a><b>2.3.1.3 <i>ná-</i> Placement:</b> The optional nature of <i>ná</i> means its placement within a sentence can be unusual. When the verb <i>ná</i> is inflected, it is usually placed in the sentence the same way as most verbs, between the subject and “object” (properly the predicate), as in <i>i atan <u>náne</u> turca</i> “the man was strong”. In the present/aorist, the <i>ná</i> can be and usually is omitted: <i>i atan (ná) turca</i> “the man is strong”. As a sentence grows in complexity, though, the omitted <i>ná</i> can be ambiguous, so sometimes the <i>ná</i> is added at the end. Consider these sentences:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>i atan turca</i> “the man [is] strong”
<li><i>i atan i cirë orcor turca (ná)</i> “the man who cuts orcs is strong”
<ul><li>Remember: Quenya <i>i</i> is both the definite article “the” and the indeclinable relative pronoun “who/which/that”.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>In a longer phrase like this, omitting the <i>ná</i> entirely can be confusing, so the speaker can tack a <i>ná</i> onto the end as a way of indicating that “this longer sentence is in fact a ‘to be’ statement”. The net result is that the <i>ná</i> often appears <u>after</u> the predicate noun or adjective. This pattern generalizes to other cases, so that impersonal “it is good” is usually <i>mára ná</i> rather than <i>ná mara</i>, “you will be good” may be <i>mára nauval</i> rather than <i>nauval mára</i>, and you can even say <i>elda nanyë</i> “an elf am I”.</p>

<p>Thus there are three places where <i>ná</i> might appear in a phrase:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Omitted completely:</b> Most common for simple subject-predicate statements, where <i>ná</i> is almost always omitted:
<ul><li><i>i nauco hesto</i> “the dwarf [is] a captain”, <i>i elda halla</i> “the elf [is] tall”.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Before the predicate:</b> Most common when <i>ná</i> is inflected for tense or pronouns:
<ul><li><i>i nauco <u>nánë</u> hesto</i> “the dwarf was a captain”, <i><u>nalyë</u> halla</i> “you are tall”.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>After the predicate:</b> Most common in complex present/aorist phrases, as well as impersonal statements:
<ul><li><i>i nauco i marë orontessë hesto <u>ná</u></i> “the dwarf who lives in the mountain is a captain”, <i>lauca <u>ná</u></i> “it is warm”.</li></ul></li>
</ol>

<p>In the last ordering, the placement is technically <u>after the predicate</u> and not at the end of the sentence. Thus if the subject is displaced from its usual position at the beginning of the sentence, the <i>ná</i> still follows the predicate noun or adjective. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>turca <u>ná</u>, quetin, i atan i cirë orcor</i> “strong is, I say, the man who cuts orcs”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reversal of predicate and subject is also possible in simple statements which omit <i>ná</i>, such as <i>halla i elda</i> “tall [is] the elf”. While Quenya typically follows the same subject-verb-object order as English, we will see that word order is freer in Quenya than it is in English. This reversed formation can only be used if something separates the adjective from the noun. “An elf [is] tall” must be <i>elda halla</i>, because <i>halla elda</i> would mean “a tall elf”. However, <i>halla i elda</i> means “tall [is] the elf” because <i>i</i> “the” separates the adjective from the noun (PE21/77-78).</p>

<p><a id="c2-3-1-4"></a><b>2.3.1.4 <i>ná-</i> Plurality Agreement:</b> When a “to be” statement compares a noun and an adjective, then the adjective must be in the plural to match a plural noun. Likewise, if a past or future form of <i>ná</i> appears and the subject noun is plural, then the inflected verb form needs the usual plural verb suffix <i>-r</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>i eldar hallë</i> “the elves are tall (<i>halla</i> + plural <i>ë</i>)”</li>
<li><i>i naucor <u>náner</u> hestor</i> “the dwarves were captains”.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a normally-omitted <i>ná</i> is restored in a complex sentence with a plural noun subject, the verb must also be marked for plurality:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>i naucor i marir orontessë turcë <u>nár</u></i> “the dwarves who live in the mountain are (<i>ná-r</i>) strong (<i>turca</i> + plural <i>ë</i>)”.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="c2-3-1-5"></a><b>2.3.1.5 <i>ná-</i> vs. Verb Tenses:</b> One last word of warning for English speakers: not every use of English “is” will correspond to a Quenya <i>ná</i>. For example, in the English sentence “the dwarves of the mountain are coming”, the verb form “are coming” is <u>not</u> a “to be” statement. It is the present continuous form of the verb “to come”, which corresponds to Quenya <i>túlar</i> (<i>túla</i>-plural). Compare:</p>

<ul>
<li>“The dwarves who live in the mountain are strong” = <i>i naucor i marir orontessë turcë nár</i>.</li>
<li>“The dwarves who live in the mountain are coming” = <i>i naucor i marir orontessë túlar</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will see other examples in this course where Quenya uses different sentence structures in cases where English would use “is/are”.</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p><a id="c2-3-1-6"></a><b>2.3.1.5 How do we know this?</b> Some parts of the above are based on Tolkien’s own notes on the usage of <i>ná</i>, but others are extrapolated from how he used <i>ná</i> in sentences, making some of the above speculative. Tolkien described the optional nature of <i>ná</i> in simple subject-predicate sentences on several occasions (PE17/93; PE21/77-78). It’s frequent displacement after the predicate was also explicitly mentioned by Tolkien (PE17/93; VT42/33), and this formation regularly appears in example sentences. The placement of inflected <i>ná</i> between subject and predicate is less clear, but seems to be supported by the small number of examples we have, such as: <i>savin Elessar ar i <u>nánë</u> aran Ondórëo</i> “I believe that E[lessar] really existed and that he was a King of Gondor” (PE22/158); <i>cé tulis, ní <u>nauva</u> tanomë</i> (VT49/19) “*if he/she comes, I will be there (<i>tanomë</i>)”, but note also <i>cé tulis, tanomë <u>nauvan</u></i> on the same page with an inflected form after the predicate.</p>

<p>The conjugation of <i>ná</i> given in <a href="#c2-3-1-2">Section 2.3.1.2</a> is mostly based on a conjugation table from 1969 (VT49/27). That conjugation actually had distinct aorist <i>nai</i> vs. present <i>ná</i> forms. However, this use of aorist <i>nai</i> never appeared in actual sentences and <i>ná</i> was frequently used in an aorist sense, so I feel comfortable saying that aorist <i>nai</i> was probably a transient idea and that <i>ná</i> was used for both present and aorist. Tolkien also experimented with other past/future forms, such as the bare tense markers <i>né</i> and <i>uva</i> for “was” and “will be” (VT49/30), but <i>náne</i> and <i>nauva</i> are what usually appear in actual sentences.</p>

<p>As for long pronouns <i>nanyë, nalyë</i> vs. short <i>nás</i>, that pattern fits most of the examples, but only <i>nás</i> appears in actual sentences (PE17/126; VT49/30). In one place Tolkien did have <i>nassë</i> “he/she is” (VT49/30), but that conflicts with the noun <i>nassë</i> “being” (PE17/174-175), so I think <i>nás</i> is better. As for the reversion to short pronoun prefixes in future/past forms, that also fits the examples (VT49/19, 28), though in the case of the past forms it was for a variant (and probably transient) past form <i>anë</i>: <i>anen, anel, anes</i> “I was, you were, he/she was” (VT49/28). Patrick Wynne discussed  various late notes on <i>ná</i> in <i>Vinyar Tengwar #49</i> (VT49/27-31).</p>

<h2><a id="c2-3-2"></a>2.3.2 The Verb <i>ëa-</i></h2>

<li><b><a href="#c2-3-2-3">2.3.2.3 <i>ëa-</i> Conjugations</a></b></li>

<p><a id="c2-3-2-1"></a><b>2.3.2.1 Usage of <i>ëa-</i></b> The closest equivalent to the verb <i>ëa-</i> is English “exist”. The Quenya word for the universe (all of existence) is the closely related word <i>Eä</i> (S/20; Let/286). Tolkien specified that the verb <i>ëa-</i> meant “exist (have being in primary world of history)” and that it was “not followed by any adj. or noun but only by a[n] adverb (or negated adverb) mainly of time” (PE22/147). In other words, the verb <i>ëa-</i> cannot be used to equate two nouns or a noun and an adjective; that’s what <i>ná-</i> is for. The verb <i>ëa-</i> can only be followed by adverbs and prepositional expressions. Compare:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Elerondo nánë elda</i> “Elrond was an Elf”.</li>
<li><i>Elerondo nánë halla</i> “Elrond was tall”.</li>
<li><i>Elerondo engë</i> “Elrond existed”.</li>
<li><i>Elerondo engë andanéya</i> “Elrond existed long ago”.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="advanced-topic">Speculative:</span> English uses “be” in expressions of location, but it seems Quenya uses <i>ëa-</i> for this purpose. These locations can be a bare adverb, a prepositional expression or a directional noun case (<i>-nna, -llo, -ssë</i>).</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Elerondo ëa palan</i> “Elrond is far”.</li>
<li><i>Elerondo ëa Endoressë</i> “Elrond is in Middle-earth”.</li>
<li><i>I sírë ëa ara i oron</i> “The river is by the mountain”.</li>
<li><i>I osto ëa ara i sírë</i> “The city is by the river”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Quenya uses <i>ëa</i> for locational statements only rarely, though. It is usually better to use more specific verbs to describe such situations:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Elerondo marë Endoressë</i> “Elrond dwells in Middle-earth”.</li>
<li><i>I sírë latë ara i oron</i> “The river lies by the mountain”.</li>
<li><i>I osto harë ara i sírë</i> “The city sits by the river”.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, for simple locational expressions the verb may simply be omitted: <i>tanomë i osto</i> “there [is] the city” (PE22/124). This aligns with Tolkien’s statement that <i>ëa</i> was used mainly with adverbs of time: it was mostly used for purely existential statements with an optional time specifier, and less often with locational statements. See section <a href="#c2-2-5-2">2.2.5.2 Verbs of Location</a> for alternate verbs you can use instead.</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<p><a id="c2-3-2-2"></a><b>2.3.2.2 How do we know this?</b> Tolkien outlined the distinction between <i>ëa-</i> “exist” (from the root EÑE) and <i>ná-</i> “be” (from the root NĀ) in <i>Late Notes on Verb Structure</i> written in 1969 (PE22/147).</p>

<p>Its use as a verb for locational statements is more speculative based only on a couple of examples: <i>Átaremma i ëa han Eä</i> = “Our father who art in Heaven, (literally) Our father who is beyond existence” (VT43/12) and <i>i Eru i or ilyë mahalmar ëa tennoio</i> “the One who is above all thrones forever”. It might not be a coincidence that both these “locational” uses of <i>ëa</i> refer to God (“Our Father” or <i>Eru</i> “the One”). As a further counterpoint to the locational function of <i>ëa</i>, see Tolkien’s note above about how it was used mainly with adverbs of time (PE22/147). There are also a examples of <i>ná</i> being used in locational statement statements, namely: <i>cé tulis, tanomë nauvan</i> “if he comes, I will be (<i>nauva</i>) there” (VT49/19). This question can be avoided just by using the alternate location verbs, as suggested above.</p>

<p>The most complete conjugation of <i>ëa-</i> appears in a note from 1969, where Tolkien specified that used the same form for the aorist and the present (VT49/29). This conjugation is presented in the next section.</p>
</div>

<p><a id="c2-3-2-3"></a><b>2.3.2.3 <i>ëa-</i> Conjugations:</b> Here is how <i>ëa-</i> is conjugated in the major Quenya verb tenses. Like <i>ná-</i>, this verb uses the same form for both the aorist and present tenses (VT49/29):</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Aorist/present:</b> <i>ëa</i> “exists”</li>
<li><b>Future:</b> <i>euva</i> “will exist”</li>
<li><b>Past:</b> <i>engë</i> “existed”</li>
<li><b>Perfect:</b> <i>engië</i> “has existed”, archaic †<i>éye</i> ¹.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Note ¹: The symbol † is another marker for words and glosses, used to indicate a particular form is archaic or poetic. Such forms are rarely used in “modern” Quenya. Compare this with modern English “yes” as opposed to more archaic †“aye, yea”. We won’t use archaic Quenya forms in exercises for this course, but they may come up in some reading samples.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="c2-3-3"></a>2.3.3 Vocabulary: People and Attributes</h2>

<p>To practice “to be” statements, here are a list nouns for different kinds of persons, followed by a list of adjectives for different qualities, some of which we’ve seen before.</p>

<ul class="vocab-list">
<li><b>atan</b> <i>n.</i> “man [human]” ¹</li>
<li><b>elda</b> <i>n.</i> “elf”</li>
<li><b>hína</b> <i>n.</i> “child”</li>
<li><b>lië</b> <i>n.</i> “people”</li>
<li><b>meldo</b> <i>n.</i> “friend”</li>
<li><b>meldë</b> <i>n.</i> “friend (f.)”</li>
<li><b>nauco</b> <i>n.</i> “dwarf”</li>
<li><b>nér</b> (<b>ner-</b>) <i>n.</i> “man [male]” ¹</li>
<li><b>nettë</b> <i>n.</i> “girl”</li>
<li><b>nís</b> (<b>niss-</b>) <i>n.</i> “woman”</li>
<li><b>perian</b> (<b>periand-</b>) <i>n.</i> “halfling”</li>
<li><b>orco</b> <i>n.</i> “orc”</li>

<li><b>seldo</b> <i>n.</i> “boy”</li>
<li><b>vendë</b> [<b>w-</b>] <i>n.</i> “maiden”</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Note ¹: As previously noted, Quenya has two different words for “man”, one for a human person of any gender (<i>atan</i>) and another for a male person of any species (<i>nér</i>). In English translations for this course, whenever we say “man” without any qualifiers we are referring to <i>atan</i> (a human) and when we mean <i>nér</i> we will specify “man [male]”. This ambiguity is a limitation of English, not Quenya.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="vocab-list">
<li><b>aiqua</b> <i>adj.</i> “steep”</li>
<li><b>anda</b> <i>adj.</i> “long”</li>
<li><b>fimbë</b> (<b>fimbi-</b>) <i>adj.</i> “thin”</li>

<li><b>urra</b> <i>adj.</i> “bad”</li>
<li><b>yána</b> <i>adj.</i> “wide”</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Note ²: The adjective <i>polda</i> refers to something that is both large and strong, or is strong due to its size. The closest English equivalent in a single word is “burly”. Something that is merely large is <i>höa</i>, and something that is strong irrespective of size is <i>turca</i>. Both <i>turca</i> and <i>polda</i> refer to physical strength, so cannot refer to something like a strong wind or river, which would be <i>turwa</i> instead: <i>turwa sírë</i> “a strong/powerful river”. The adjective <i>turwa</i> can also apply to people, but refers to power and strength of a non-physical kind, such as political power.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a reminder, the ^ reliability marker indicates forms adapted from early or rejected forms of Quenya. The forms in parenthesis indicate noun stems, used in inflected forms: <i>nér</i> (<i>ner-</i>) “man” means the uninflected form is <i>nér</i>, but with suffixes it becomes <i>ner-</i> as in plural <i>neri</i> “men”. The bracket notations like [<b>w-</b>] and [<b>þ</b>] appears for the first time in this vocabulary list and indicates the archaic pronunciation, which can be important to tengwar spelling as discussed in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-04.html">Chapter 4</a>. For example <i>vendë</i> [<i>w-</i>] means the modern pronunciation is <i>vendë</i> “maiden” versus archaic/poetic †<i>wendë</i>. These archaic pronunciations will be discussed further in <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-03.html">Chapter 3</a>.</p>

<li><b><a href="#x2-4">Exercise 2.4</a></b></li>
</ul>

<p>This section discusses the full set of features for vocabulary entries in this course.</p>

<h2><a id="c2-4-1"></a>2.4.1 Elements of Word Entries</h2>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="#c2-4-1-1">2.4.1.1 Basic Vocabulary Elements</a></b></li>
<li><b><a href="#c2-4-1-2">2.4.1.2 Reliability Markers</a></b></li>
<li><b><a href="#c2-4-1-5">2.4.1.3 Language Markers</a></b></li>
</ul>

<p><a id="c2-4-1-1"></a><b>2.4.1.1 Basic Vocabulary Elements:</b> The basic elements of a word entry are as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>soron</b> (<b>sorn-</b>) [<b>þ</b>] <i>n.</i> “eagle”</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>The first value is always the Quenya word itself in bold: <b>soron</b>.</li>
<li>This may be followed by a word stem, in parentheses, to inflections are added: (<b>sorn-</b>).
<ul><li>If there is no stem, the word it is own stem.</li></ul></li>
<li>This may be followed by archaic pronunciation notes in brackets: [<b>þ</b>], [<b>ñ-</b>] or [<b>w-</b>].
<ul>
<li>A [<b>þ</b>] represents an older pronunciation (IPA [θ] = “th”) for any <i>s</i> in the word.</li>
<li>A [<b>ñ-</b>] represents an older pronunciation (IPA [ŋ] = “ng”) for an initial <i>n-</i> in the word.</li>
<li>A [<b>w-</b>] represents an older pronunciation for an initial <i>v-</i> in the word.</li>
<li>If absent, the archaic pronunciation is similar to the modern pronunciation.</li>
<li>These notes are important for tengwar spelling, which still reflect classical pronunciation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This is followed by the part of speech: <i>n.</i>, <i>pron.</i>, <i>adj.</i>, etc.</li>
<li>Finally it ends with the translation or gloss, in quotes: “eagle”.</li>
</ol>

<p>The entries for verbs (<i>v.</i>) are a bit different:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>har-</b> <i>v.</i> “to sit, stay”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> ^<b>handë</b> “sat, stayed”</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>The word is always given in its stem form: <b>har-</b>.</li>
<li>Entries in this course also include the past tense: <i>pa.t</i> <b>handë</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Strictly speaking the glosses are not perfectly accurate translations, since the meaning of Quenya words do not exactly overlap with the meaning of English words. Where a Quenya word has several glosses, its meaning encapsulates all of those glosses, but this doesn’t mean it can be used in all the same circumstances. Simple words like “eagle” are generally clear, but words with more complex meanings like <i>har-</i> “sit, stay” could correspond to either English word in various circumstances. Full word definitions are beyond the scope of this course, through some words are discussed in more detail in the vocabulary entries if their definitions are of particular interest.</p>

<p><a id="c2-4-1-2"></a><b>2.4.1.2 Reliability Markers:</b> The past tense ^<i>handë</i> of <i>har-</i> above includes a reliability marker, which indicates our level of knowledge for a given item. The reliability markers used in this course are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unmarked items are attested, which mean they appear somewhere in Tolkien’s writing.</li>
<li># items only appear in an inflected form, with base word extracted from that inflection.</li>
<li>* items do not appear directly, but are deducible from other forms or aspects of the language.</li>
<li>^ items are adapted from rejected or earlier forms of the language.</li>
<li>? items are educated guesses based on other materials.</li>
<li>! items are fan-invented forms, also called neologisms = new words.</li>
</ul>

<p>These markers can apply to the words themselves, inflections of a word such as its past tense, or even individual glosses. Reliability markers only appear in the vocabulary entries, since including them in example sentences would be very messy.</p>

<p><a id="c2-4-1-3"></a><b>2.4.1.3 Language Markers:</b> This course rarely makes use of language markers, since almost all the Elvish words in the course are Quenya. They appear occasionally, however, and are useful for understanding the online dictionary associated with this course: <a href="https://eldamo.org">https://eldamo.org</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Q. is used for Quenya words.</li>
<li>S. is used for Sindarin words (Tolkien’s other major Elvish language).</li>
<li>† is used for archaic or poetic words.</li>
<li>✶ marks ancient word forms from Primitive Elvish.</li>
<li>√ marks a primitive base or root, sometimes also represented in ALLCAPS.</li>
<li>ᴱ superscript marks Early Period forms: ᴱQ. = Early Qenya of the 1910s and 20s.</li>
<li>ᴹ superscript marks Middle Period forms: ᴹQ. = Middle Quenya of the 1930s and 40s.</li>
<li>ᴺ superscript marks Neo-Language constructions by authors other than Tolkien: ᴺQ. = Neo-Quenya.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="c2-4-2"></a>2.4.2 Word Stems</h2>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="#c2-4-2-1">2.4.2.1 Noun Stems</a></b></li>
<li><b><a href="#c2-4-2-2">2.4.2.2 Verb Stems</a></b></li>
<li><b><a href="#c2-4-2-3">2.4.2.3 Stems and Compounds</a></b></li>
</ul>

<p>It is fairly common for Quenya words to have different forms with and without inflections. Vocabulary entries use the uninflected form (also known as the simplex), followed by the stem form in parenthesis if it is different from the uninflected form.</p>

<p><a id="c2-4-2-1"></a><b>2.4.2.1 Noun Stems:</b> One common reason for nouns to have different stems forms is for there to have been sound losses, usually consonant reductions, that occurred in the simplex that did not occur in inflected forms. An example of this is <i>perian</i> (<i>periand-</i>) “halfling”, where the final <i>nd</i> reduced to <i>n</i> in the simplex (<i>perian</i>) but was retained in inflected forms like <i>periandi</i> “halflings”. In such cases, the stem is longer than the simplex.</p>

<p>Sometimes, though, the sound losses were in the inflected forms. An example of this <i>soron</i> (<i>sorn-</i>) “eagle”, where the second <i>o</i> was preserved in the simplex (<i>soron</i>) but was lost when inflections were added: <i>sorni</i> “eagles”. In such cases, the stem is shorter than the simplex.</p>

<p><a id="c2-4-2-2"></a><b>2.4.2.2 Verb Stems:</b> Verbs are different from nouns in that the vocabulary entries show the stem form rather than the simplex: <i>mat-</i> “to eat”. The verb stem is the basis for the verbs conjugations into tenses (aorist, present, future, past, perfect), but unlike nouns a verb can only be used in a conjugated form: <i>matë, máta, matuva, mantë, amátië</i> “eats, is eating, will eat, ate, has eaten”. In a sense, each of these tense-forms is itself a stem, to which further suffixes like pronominal inflections are added, e.g. <i>máta</i> “is eating”, <i>mátan</i> “I am eating” (<i>máta-n</i>).</p>

<p>Similar to nouns with distinct stem forms, the aorist stem of basic verbs has a different form in the simplex (<i>matë</i>) as opposed to when it is inflected (<i>mati-</i>). It is the same basic phenomenon at play, where an ancient <i>i</i> changed to <i>ë</i> in the simplex but was retained with inflections: <i>matin</i> “I eat” (<i>mati-n</i>).</p>

<div class="advanced-topic">
<h2><a id="c2-4-3"></a>2.4.3 Advanced Topic: Dictionaries</h2>

<p>This course includes quite a bit of vocabulary, but it cannot cover the entire breadth of known Quenya words, or the nuances of individual definitions. Fortunately, there are a number of online dictionaries that include many more Quenya words than appear in this course. My current recommendations (as of 2022) are the sites:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Parf Edhellen:</b> <a href="https://www.elfdict.com">https://www.elfdict.com</a></li>
<li><b>Eldamo:</b> <a href="https://eldamo.org">https://eldamo.org</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Of the two, Parf Edhellen is more “beginner friendly”, and more accessible to non-experts. Eldamo (my own dictionary) is more academically oriented and includes a lot of extra detail that can be overwhelming to beginners, but those extra details can be helpful as you develop more knowledge. Both of these dictionaries can be used as additional resources for more vocabulary. The two sites are based on similar data sets, so there is very little in Eldamo that is not also in Parf Edhellen, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Dictionaries can be dangerous for beginners to use, however, for two reasons. First, dictionaries don’t teach you grammar, and just stringing together words from a dictionary without any grammatical background will usually produce gibberish. Second, dictionaries typically include words from the entire breadth of Tolkien’s life, including early (and possibly abandoned) words from his youth, along with other words he used later in his life but were only transient notions he quickly discarded. It requires some degree of expertise to sort out “good” words from the “bad” words, with the added complication that even experts don’t always agree which words are which.</p>

<p>One of the main goals of this course is to provide you with the necessary background information to help you make these finer distinctions. The course can’t cover all the relevant issues (things can get <u>very</u> complicated), but it should teach you enough that you can avoid the major pitfalls and use online dictionaries with some degree of safety.</p>

<p>In fact, once you complete this course, you will likely “graduate” from using only the vocabulary presented here and will start using the dictionaries instead. That’s partly because the dictionaries will have more words, but also because the best dictionaries include more recent information from new research that is not reflected in the course. The nature of introductory language courses is such that they can’t always stay current with the latest-and-greatest information from new publications, and this course (like the ones before it) will almost certainly lag behind our best understanding of the Quenya language.</p>

<p>However, you need to learn the basics before you can grapple with more complex notions, so for now I recommend sticking with the course’s vocabulary lists, and wait until you know more before exploring the dictionaries.</p>

<h2><a id="c2-4-4"></a>2.4.4 Vocabulary: Sea and Sky</h2>

<p>Here are some vocabulary words having to do with the sea:</p>

<ul class="vocab-list">
<li><b>cirya</b> <i>n.</i> “ship”</li>
<li><b>ciryamo</b> <i>n.</i> “sailor”</li>
<li><b>ëar</b> <i>n.</i> “sea”</li>
<li><b>falma</b> <i>n.</i> “wave”</li>
<li><b>falassë</b> <i>n.</i> “shore”</li>
<li><b>londë</b> <i>n.</i> “haven, harbour”</li>
<li><b>luntë</b> <i>n.</i> “boat”</li>
<li>^<b>lut-</b> <i>v.</i> “to float, sail”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> ^<b>luntë</b> “floated, sailed”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>tol(lë)</b> <i>n.</i> “island”</li>
<li><b>tyulma</b> <i>n.</i> “mast”</li>
<li><b>vingë</b> [<b>w-</b>] <i>n.</i> “foam”</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some vocabulary words having to do with the sky:</p>

<ul class="vocab-list">
<li><b>Anar</b> <i>n.</i> “Sun”</li>
<li><b>cal-</b> <i>v.</i> “to shine” ¹
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> ^<b>callë</b> “shone”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>elen</b> <i>n.</i> “star”</li>
<li><b>fanya</b> <i>n.</i> “cloud”</li>
<li><b>fanyarë</b> <i>n.</i> “the skies, upper airs” ²</li>
<li><b>hwesta</b> <i>n.</i> “breeze”</li>
<li><b>Isil</b> [<b>þ</b>] <i>n.</i> “Moon”</li>
<li><b>lumbo</b> <i>n.</i> “(dark) cloud”</li>
<li><b>menel</b> <i>n.</i> “sky, the heavens” ²</li>
<li><b>sil-</b> <i>v.</i> “to shine (white)” ¹
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> ?<b>sillë</b> “shone (while)”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>súrë</b> (<b>súri-</b>) <i>n.</i> “wind”</li>
<li><b>vil-</b> [<b>w-</b>] <i>v.</i> “to fly”
<ul><li><i>pa.t.</i> <b>villë</b> “flew”</li></ul></li>
<li><b>vilya</b> [<b>w-</b>] <i>v.</i> “air, (lower) sky” ²</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Note ²: Quenya has two words for “shine”, <i>cal-</i> and <i>sil-</i>. The word <i>cal-</i> is for warm and golden light, while <i>sil-</i> is for cool and silver/white light. In other words, <i>Anar calë</i> “the Sun shines”, but <i>Isil silë</i> “the Moon shines (white)”. Likewise “lamps shine” = <i>calmar calir</i> but “stars shine” = “eleni silir”.</li>
<li>Note ³: The word <i>menel</i> is “sky” in the sense of “the heavens”, where the stars are, viewed by the elves as a dome covering the earth (<i>cemen</i>). It’s too high up for birds, who fly in the <i>vilya</i> “(lower) sky”, which also acts as the word for “air” generally. Between these is the <i>fanyarë</i> of the “upper airs”, where clouds are. From lowest to highest: <i>vilya</i> &gt; <i>fanyarë</i> &gt; <i>menel</i>. All of these might be translated “sky” in English.</li>
</ul>

<p>Recall from the first chapter that Quenya does not use the definite article <i>i</i> for known unique things the way that English does, so where English would say “the Sun, the Moon, the sky/heavens”, Quenya says only <i>Anar, Isil, menel</i>.</p>

<h2><a id="x2-4"></a>Exercise 2.4</h2>

<p>Since this section didn’t introduce any new grammar, this exercise is mainly about practicing the vocabulary above.</p>

<p>As a quick refresher, recall from <a href="eldamo-intro-quenya-01.html#c1-5-1">Chapter 1</a> the three Quenya conjuctions: <i>ar</i> “and”, <i>hya</i> “or” and <i>mal</i> “but”, as well as indeclinable relative pronoun <i>i</i> “who, which, that” and declinable relative pronouns <i>ya</i> “which, that” <i>ya</i> “which, that” (for things) and <i>ye</i> “who, that” (for people and animals).</p>

<p>Translate the following into English:</p>

<ol class="exercise-list">
<li><i>I cirya luntë et i ëarello ar mi londenna.</i></li>
<li><i>I nér i hára i falassessë ciryamo ná.</i></li>
